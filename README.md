# sick-fits

This is a repository I created to accompany my viewing of [Advanced React & GraphQL](https://github.com/wesbos/Advanced-React).

## Setting up prisma

The backend of this application uses [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) as its data layer as well as the [Prisma Cloud](https://www.prisma.io/). Please go to the directory `backend` and run:

```bash
npm i -g prisma
```

This will install the Prisma CLI tool.

## Starting the project on your local computer

### Frontend

Please run `npm run dev` to start the project. Open [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777) to view it in the browser.

## Visual Studio Code Extensions

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my current editor. Here is a list of a couple of extensions I use:

* [Reactjs code snippets](https://github.com/xabikos/vscode-react)
* [vscode-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/vscode-styled-components)
* [GraphQL for VSCode](https://github.com/kumarharsh/graphql-for-vscode)
